/*
  Designed for itsy bitsy 32u4
  "AVR109 compatible (same as Flora, Feather 32u4, Leonardo, etc)"

  sleep till: switch or watchdog
  
  startup:
  ** fast flashing while waiting for serial
  ** slow flashing for about 1 second
  ** start with a short pulse
  ** run:

  On swtich close: if it has been > 1 sec since last switch close: restart pattern of pulses
  While switch close, run pulse-pattern
  continue the pulse-pattern for 1 second after the switch opens

  while switch is on:
    send a pulse sequence out (to driver transistor)
  Because a second xmitter is blocked if it overlaps,
    we need 2 patterns that can't always overlap:
  The SL-jumper (ao->gnd) designates short-gap (open), long-gap (closed).
  Correspondance to "A" or "B" is not required at all:
    that is encoded in the hard-wired keyfob.

  std programmer: AVRISP mkii
  If the BUILTIN is throbbing, then you are in bootloader mode:
  (press reset to get into bootloader mode)
  You have about 2 seconds to hit upload,
  so hit reset again if you miss it.

  todo: sleep, power reduction
