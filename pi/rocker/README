Label the Rocker/Receiver/Pi

The initial labels are A and B for the hardware.
Decide which is the comet and which the coal.

Label:
* keyfob
* receiver
* video file
* Pi jumper pin location

Connecting the Pi

* Disconnect the power from the Pi. We want it off to start.
* Hook up the Pi to the monitor/projector HDMI.
* Turn on the monitor/projector.
* Plug in the Pi.
* After a few moments, you should see the splash screen, and then the desktop.
* You might see the movie instead of the desktop.

A/B Configuration

There is an "A" and a "B" set of Rocker + PI + Video.
A letter sould be written on the keyfob for the rocker, and receiver board for the PI.

If the correct video is not playing on the Pi, "open" the jumpers:
* The video should stop, and a message should appear.

Place a jumper on the Pi to designate it as A or B:
    A 33/34
    B 39/40
The program on the Pi will detect the pin to decide if the Pi is A or B,
and thus which video to play, and which keyfob to listen to.

The video should change soon after you make any change to the jumper.

Name the videos with a prefix "A" or "B", e.g.:
    A-comet-test.mov
    B-coal-esperiment.mov
The videos should be copied to the Pi, into the rocker/ folder.
There should only be 2 videos in that folder.
