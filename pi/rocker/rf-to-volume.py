"""
Respond to the corresponding keyfob/rocker by fading the LEFT channel volume in/out.

We do need to know if we are "A" or "B", so we know which receiver "data" to look at: see ab_jumpers()

We have "persistance": the transmitter sends a pulse every 4 seconds or so to indicate "on",
so we stay on for that long (at least) before deciding it has gone "off".

Works with the default audio out: either hdmi or headphone-jack.
